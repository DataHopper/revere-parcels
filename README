#Overview
This document provides an overview of the 2017 real estate tax parcel data set for the City of Revere, compiled and made available through MassGIS. There are 15,109 records in the data set, each associated with an individual parcel. Tax parcels are not the same as land parcels, however, as multiple tax parcels can exist on a single piece of land (a condo building, for example). This data set includes information for 12,780 lots (LOC_IDs). Each parcel record (PROP_ID) includes information on its assessed value, legal use, size, address, physical characteristics, and ownership information. This information can be used to explore the built environment in the City of Revere, including land use patterns, density of development, real estate transactions and valuation.
